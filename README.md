# Back-Propagation
Back propagation algorithm (Vanilla MLP)

A Multi-layer Perceptron is build to classify a data-set. The model consists of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. The model can be used for training on any dataset.

Change the name of the dataset csv files in import_data() function to use it for your dataset. Hyperparameters like number of hidden nodes, step_size, epochs, tolerance, train-test split, etc can be tweaked to get a better fitted the model.
