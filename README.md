# Back-Propagation
Back propagation algorithm (Vanilla MLP)

A Multi-layer Perceptron is build to classify the given data-set. The data-set consists of 24754 samples,
each with 784 features divided into 4 classes (0,1,2,3). The labels are hot-encoded. The model consists of
one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.
